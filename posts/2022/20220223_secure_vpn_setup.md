# Secure VPN setup

There are few good choices like OpenVPN, [SoftEther](https://www.softether.org/), [Pritunl](http://pritunl.com) etc. If you prefer something much more robust, I'd suggest to take look at [strongSwan](https://www.strongswan.org) (IPSec + ESP). If you prefer something temporary just use ssh tunnel `ssh -D 9050 user@server` ,  install [proxychains](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng) and `proxychains firefox  `, vola you're traffic is encrypted. The only issue is, it's hard use socks proxy on un-rooted mobile phone and sessions are temporary.

I choose OpenVPN since it's widely used and it's easy to configure. However OpenVPN has it's drawbacks, it's easier to detect if a person is using OpenVPN by checking the packet MTU size.


### Creating FreeBSD server on Azure

Create a new freebsd 10.3 instance on Azure, generate SSH key using the following command

    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout vpn_server.key -out vpn_server.pem

Don't forget to change the default username (azureuser) and block all ports except 22 till we configure the VPN server. You may wonder why FreeBSD, well here's the resource usage on a fully functional vpn server

### Enable IP packet forwarding

Enable IP forwarding on the server by setting `net.inet.ip.forwarding=1` in sysctl.conf file.


    sudo sysctl net.inet.ip.forwarding=1
    sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf


### Enable packet filter (pf)

`pf` is the freebsd version of iptables, OpenVPN `10.8.0.0/24` must be routed properly, open `/etc/pf.conf` as root and add the following configuration


    ext_if=hn0 # if your interface is eth0 then use that instead
    openvpn_subnet="{10.8.0.0/24}"

    # similar to iptables -t nat -a POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o hn0 -j MASQUERADE
    nat on $ext_if from $openvpn_subnet to any -> ($ext_if)


Start pf by default using `sudo sysrc pf=yes`  after system reboot.


### Installing DNSCrypt and Unbound

Install dnscrypt-proxy on the FreeBSD ` sudo pkg install dnscrypt-proxy`. Update the `/etc/rc.conf` file so the dnscrypt autostarts after reboots, add the following config to `/etc/rc.conf`. `cs-useast` is the dnscrypt provider is closest to the server location, you can choose one that's closest to you from this [list](https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv)


    # dnscrypt-proxy
    dnscrypt_proxy_enable="YES"
    dnscrypt_proxy_flags="-a 127.0.0.1:54"
    dnscrypt_proxy_resolver="cs-useast"
    dnscrypt_proxy_logfile="/dev/null"


Install unbound to act as a local dns cache `sudo pkg install unbound`. Edit the unbound config file ` /var/unbound/unbound.conf` using sudo and add the following configuration

    server:
      username: unbound
      directory: /var/unbound
      chroot: /var/unbound
      do-not-query-localhost: no
      interface: 0.0.0.0
      access-control: 0.0.0.0/0 refuse   # disable access to rest of the world
      access-control: 127.0.0.0/8 allow  # enable access to local network
      access-control: 10.8.0.0/24 allow  # enable access to OpenVPN subnet
      hide-identity: yes
      hide-version: yes
      auto-trust-anchor-file: "/var/unbound/root.key"

    #include: /var/unbound/forward.conf
    #include: /var/unbound/lan-zones.conf
    #include: /var/unbound/control.conf

    forward-zone:
       name: "." # use for ALL queries
       forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@40 # dnscrypt-proxy

Update the default DNS resolvers on `/etc/resolv.conf` to use unbound, `127.0.0.1` on port 53 as the default dns resolver

    # Generated by resolvconf
    # search XXXXXX.c4.internal.cloudapp.net
    # nameserver XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX

    # unbound + dnscrypt-proxy
    nameserver 127.0.0.1

Start the unbound server after reboot `sudo sysrc local_unbound_enable=YES`, by default the unbound used the config file located at `/var/unbound/unbound.conf`. If you plan to use different location, update the `/etc/rc.conf` file to pass the config file we saved in STEP2 to unbound after reboot

    # Unbound
    unbound_flags="-c /var/unbound/unbound.conf"

Reboot the server `sudo reboot` and test the DNS resolution with the following command

    drill -S freebsd.org

       # this should print somethink like
       ;; Number of trusted keys: 1
        ;; Chasing: freebsd.org. A

        DNSSEC Trust tree:

### Installing OpenVPN

Install openvpn and easy-rsa by running `sudo pkg install openvpn easy-rsa`. Create a new directory `sudo mkdir /usr/local/etc/openvpn` and copy sample configuration file and easy-rsa files.

    cp /usr/local/share/examples/openvpn/sample-config-files/server.conf \
           /usr/local/etc/openvpn/openvpn.conf

    cp -r /usr/local/share/easy-rsa /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa

Edit the `vars` file under `/usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa` and change the following,

    cd /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa

    sudo vi vars

    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_COUNTRY     "US"  # "COUNTRY"
    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_PROVINCE    "NY"  # "PROVINCE"
    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CITY        "New York"  # "CITY"
    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_ORG         "ORG"  # "ORGANIZATION"
    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_EMAIL       "admin@localhost"  # "EMAIL"
    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_OU          "VPN Server"  # "ORGANIZATIONAL UNIT"
    set_var EASYRSA_REQ_CN          "vpn" # COMMON_NAME
    set_var EASYRSA_KEY_SIZE        4096 # set key size to 4096
    set_var EASYRSA_CA_EXPIRE       3650 # Set self-signed CA to expire after 10 years
    set_var EASYRSA_CERT_EXPIRE     1825 # Set cert to expire after 5 years, don't worry even if you lost
                                         # the certs or if they are compromised, you can revoke them.

Now start generating the keys, now run `sudo ./easyrsa.real help` to print the list of commands. Lets start with building PKI


### Build Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

Initialize PKI by running `init-pki`

    sudo ./easyrsa.real init-pki

    -- Output --

    Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: ./vars

    init-pki complete; you may now create a CA or requests.
    Your newly created PKI dir is: /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki

Once PKI is initialized, run `build-ca` to build CA, It will ask for a password and a common name, use a strong random password because it's used to encrypt the key and if the password is compromised, it'll compromise entire PKI.

**Tip**: `cat /dev/urandom | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1` to generate 32 char long random string

    sudo ./easyrsa.real build-ca

        -- Output --

        Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: ./vars
        Generating a 4096 bit RSA private key
        ....................++
        .................++
        writing new private key to '/usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/ca.key.UCYBDDSvsh'

        Enter PEM pass phrase:
        Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:

        -----
        You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
        into your certificate request.
        What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
        There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
        For some fields there will be a default value,
        If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
        -----
        Common Name (eg: your user, host, or server name) [Easy-RSA CA]:

        CA creation complete and you may now import and sign cert requests.
        Your new CA certificate file for publishing is at:
        /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt

Now generate the vpn server certificate with `sudo ./easyrsa.real build-server-full openvpn-server nopass` with certificate name as `openvpn-server` and without the password. It'll ask the password for ca.key, enter the password used in the previous step.

    # ./easyrsa.real build-server-full openvpn-server nopass

    Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: ./vars

    Enter pass phrase for /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/ca.key:
    Check that the request matches the signature
    Signature ok
    The Subject's Distinguished Name is as follows
    commonName            :ASN.1 12:'openvpn-server'
    Certificate is to be certified until Nov 11 21:30:50 2021 GMT (1825 days)

    Write out database with 1 new entries
    Data Base Updated

Check the certificate with `sudo ./easyrsa.real show-cert openvpn-server`, it should print something like this

    Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: ./vars

    Showing cert details for 'openvpn-server'.
    This file is stored at:
    /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/openvpn-server.crt

                X509v3 Key Usage:
                    Digital Signature, Key Encipherment

Once the server certificate is generated, build a client certificate `sudo ./easyrsa.real build-client-full <UNIQUE_NAME_GOES_HERE> nopass`, `nopass` leaves the client key unencrypted, it's upto you if you want to leave it that way. If you need client certificates for another device, repeat the above step but make sure you use a different name.

    sudo ./easyrsa.real build-client-full desktop nopass

    Note: using Easy-RSA configuration from: ./vars
    Generating a 4096 bit RSA private key
    .....................................................................................................
    ...................................................................++
    writing new private key to '/usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/desktop.key.m4nxiIGhou'
    -----
    Using configuration from /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/openssl-1.0.cnf
    Enter pass phrase for /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/ca.key:
    Check that the request matches the signature
    Signature ok
    The Subject's Distinguished Name is as follows
    commonName            :ASN.1 12:'desktop'
    Certificate is to be certified until Nov 11 21:42:07 2021 GMT (1825 days)

    Write out database with 1 new entries
    Data Base Updated

finally generate Diffie Hellman parameters `dh.pem` using `sudo ./easyrsa.real gen-dh`. This openssl uses generator 2 by default but if you want more secure prime, use generator 5 ( it takes a while to generate a 4096 bit long prime, please be patient)

    sudo ./easyrsa.real gen-dh

Create a directory `keys` in `/usr/local/etc/openvpn`, copy the generated keys to `/usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys`.

    cd /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa
    cp pki/dh.pem pki/ca.crt pki/issued/openvpn-server.crt \
        pki/private/openvpn-server.key /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys

Copy the individual keys to the respective client.

    Client Cert: /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/issued/<name>.crt
    Client Key: /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/private/<name>.key
    CA Cert:    /usr/local/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa/pki/ca.crt
    # archive the above files for easy distribution.
    # use scp or rsync to download the archive.
    tar czvf desktop.tar.gz pki/ca.crt pki/issued/desktop.crt pki/private/desktop.key


### Generate OpenVPN server and client config files

Now edit the OpenVPN server configuration file `openvpn.conf`, first change dir to `cd /usr/local/etc/openvpn` and edit the `openvpn.conf` file we copied in the initial steps or simply copy-paste the following configuration

    # Server configuration
    ;listen IPADDRESS_OF_NIC

    # Port
    ;port 1194 # best to use a random port
    port YYYYY

    # TCP or UDP
    proto udp

    # Routed IP tunnel
    dev tun

    # Cert and keys
    ca /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt
    cert /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/openvpn-server.crt
    key /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/openvpn-server.key
    dh /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/dh.pem

    # HMAC
    # both server and client must have copy of ta.key
    # ta.key 0 --> server
    # ta.key 1 --> client
    tls-auth /usr/local/etc/openvpn/keys/ta.key 0

    # Cryptographic cipher
    # select AES 256 bit
    cipher AES-256-CBC

    # tls support
    remote-cert-tls client

    server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
    ifconfig-pool-persist ipp.txt
    push "redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp"

    # Force clients to use unbound + dnscrypt-proxy server
    push "dhcp-option DNS 10.8.0.1"

    # Allow clients to see each other
    ;client-to-client

    # Resume client config for multiple users
    ;duplicate-cn

    # Ping client every 10 secs
    keepalive 10 120

    # Disable compression
    # you can enable it if you like
    ;comp-lzo

    # Privileges, chroot
    # chroot /var/openvpn

    user nobody
    group nobody

    # The persist options will try to avoid
    # accessing certain resources on restart
    # that may no longer be accessible because
    # of the privilege downgrade.
    persist-key
    persist-tun

    # client status information
    status openvpn-status.log

    # log
    log openvpn.log
    # presistant log accross reboots
    ;log-append  openvpn.log
    verb 4
    mute 20

Now let's create the client openvpn configuration file and copy paste the following config. Make sure you replace all the certs i.e copy ca.crt and past it inbetween `<ca> </ca>` tags, change server ip address (XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX) and port (YYYYY)

    #Run in client mode
    client

    # tun/tap
    dev tun

    # TCP or UDP
    proto udp

    # remote SERVER_IP_ADDRESS SERVER_OPENVPN_PORT
    # you can add multiple OpenVPN servers to load balance
    # between them. Enable remote-random to tell client to
    # choose a random server

    remote XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX YYYYY

    ;remote-random

    # keep retrying if connection is lost
    # enable this if one of your clients is
    # a mobile or laptop
    resolv-retry infinite

    nobind

    # if non-windows systems enable
    ;user nobody
    ;group nobody

    persist-key
    persist-tun

    # tls auth
    remote-cert-tls server

    # Enable if server has compression enabled
    ;comp-lzo


    # logging
    verb 4
    mute 20

    # Use same cipher as server
    cipher AES-256-CBC


    # ca ca.crt
    # cert client.crt
    # key client.key
    # tls-auth ta.key 1

    # You can also embed the files within the config, easier for distribution.
    #ca [inline]
    #cert [inline]
    #key [inline]
    #tls-auth [inline] 1

    key-direction 1

    # ca.crt
    #<ca>
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
    #</ca>

    # client.crt
    #<cert>

    #</cert>

    # client.key
    #<key>

    #</key>

    # ta.key
    #< tls-auth >

    #</tls-auth>

Now we just need to enable openvpn to run as a daemon and reboot the system

    sudo sysrc openvpn_enable="YES"
    sudo sysrc openvpn_if="tun"
    sudo reboot

Download the client configuration files and import them into your network manager. That's it, your network traffic is now encrypted.

Tip: OpenVPN on android recognized `.ovpn` files, simply replace the `client.conf --> client.ovpn`

Well then, I'm gonna go and play [0 A.D](https://play0ad.com/).
